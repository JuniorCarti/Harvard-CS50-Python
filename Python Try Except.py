#The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
#The except block lets you handle the error.
#The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.
#The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.
#Exception Handling
try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("An exception occurred")

  #Many Exceptions
  #You can define as many exception blocks as you want, 
  #e.g. if you want to execute a special block of code for a special kind of error:
  #Print one message if the try block raises a NameError and another for other errors:
try:
  print(x)
except NameError:
  print("Variable x is not defined")
except:
  print("Something else went wrong")

  #Else
  #You can use the else keyword to define a block of code to be executed if no errors were raised:

try:
  print("Hello")
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
else:
  print("Nothing went wrong")

#Finally
#The finally block, if specified, will be executed regardless if the try block raises an error or not.
try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
finally:
  print("The 'try except' is finished")

#Try to open and write to a file that is not writable:

  except:

  finally:
    f.close()
except:
  print("Something went wrong when opening the file")

#Raise an exception
#As a Python developer you can choose to throw an exception if a condition occurs.
#To throw (or raise) an exception, use the raise keyword.
x = -1

if x < 0:
  raise Exception("Sorry, no numbers below zero")

#The raise keyword is used to raise an exception.
#You can define what kind of error to raise, and the text to print to the user.

#Example 2: Catching all errors (not recommended for production)

#Example 3: Using else and finally

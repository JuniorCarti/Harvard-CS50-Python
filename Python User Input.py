#User Input
#Python allows for user input.
#That means we are able to ask the user for input.
#The following example asks for your name, and when you enter a name, it gets printed on the screen:
#user input

name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

v = 5
print("The value of v is: " + str(v))

d = 10
print("The value of d is: " + str(d))

e = 15
print("The value of e is: " + str(e))

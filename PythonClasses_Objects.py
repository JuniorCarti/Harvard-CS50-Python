#python  classes and objects
#A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
#To create a class, use the keyword class:
#Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
class myClass:
    x = 5

#Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:
#Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
p1 = myClass
print(p1.x)

#Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
# You can display a string literal with the print() function:
# x = "Hello World"
# y = 'Hello World'
# print(x)

x= "Hello World"
y= 'Hello World'
print(x)

#Quotes Inside Quotes
# You can use three double quotes or three single quotes to create a multiline string.
# x = """Hello
# World"""
# y = '''Hello
# World'''
# print(x)
# print(y)

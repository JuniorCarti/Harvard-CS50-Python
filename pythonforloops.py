#Python For Loops
#A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
#For loops in Python are control flow statements that allow you to repeatedly execute 
#a block of code for each item in a sequence (like lists, tuples, strings, etc.). 
# They follow this basic syntax:
#for item in iterable:
    # code to execute

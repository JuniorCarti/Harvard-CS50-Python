#Python For Loops
#A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
#For loops in Python are control flow statements that allow you to repeatedly execute 
#a block of code for each item in a sequence (like lists, tuples, strings, etc.). 
# They follow this basic syntax:
#for item in iterable:
    # code to execute
#Core Components
#1. The Iterable
#Any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time:
"""Lists: [1, 2, 3]
Strings: "Hello"
Tuples: (1, 2, 3)
Dictionaries: {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
Sets: {1, 2, 3}
Range objects: range(5)
File objects
Generators"""

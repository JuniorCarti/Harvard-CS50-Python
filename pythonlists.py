#Lists are created using square brackets:

#Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
#Lists are ordered, meaning that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
#When you create a list, you will always get the same order.
#If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

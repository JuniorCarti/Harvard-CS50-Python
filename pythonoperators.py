#Python Operators
#Python Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
#Python Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
#In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
#x = 5
#y = 10
#z = x + y
# print(z)
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y
print(z)

#Python Arithmetic Operators
#Python Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and values.
#subtraction
#addition
#multiplication
#division
#modulus

#exponentiation
#floor division
#Python Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and values.
#In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y
print(z)
#In the example below, we use the - operator to subtract two values:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x - y
print(z)
#In the example below, we use the * operator to multiply two values:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x * y
print(z)

#In the example below, we use the / operator to divide two values:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x / y
print(z)

#Python Operators
#Python Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
#Python Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
#In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
#x = 5
#y = 10
#z = x + y
# print(z)
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y
print(z)

#Python Arithmetic Operators
#Python Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and values.
#subtraction
#addition
#multiplication
#division
#modulus

#exponentiation
#floor division
#Python Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and values.
#In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y
print(z)
#In the example below, we use the - operator to subtract two values:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x - y
print(z)
#In the example below, we use the * operator to multiply two values:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x * y
print(z)

#In the example below, we use the / operator to divide two values:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x / y
print(z)

#In the example below, we use the % operator to get the modulus of two values:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x % y
print(z)

#In the example below, we use the ** operator to get the exponent of two values:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x ** y
print(z)

#In the example below, we use the // operator to get the floor division of two values:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x // y
print(z)

#Python Assignment Operators
#Python Assignment Operators are used to assign values to variables.
#=
#+=
#-=
#*=
#/=
#%=
#**=
#//=
x+= 5
y = 10
z = x + y
print(z)

#python bitwise operators
#python bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on variables and values.
#&
#|
#^
#~
#<<
#>>
#operator precedence
#operator precedence is the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.
#example:
#x = 5
#y = 10
#z = x + y * 2
#In the example above, the multiplication operator (*) has a higher precedence than the addition operator (+), so the multiplication is performed first.
#This means that the expression is evaluated as follows:
#z = x + (y * 2)
#z = 5 + (10 * 2)
#z = 5 + 20
#z = 25
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y * 2
print(z)

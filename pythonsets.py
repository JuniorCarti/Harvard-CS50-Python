#Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, 
# the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
#A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
#Sets are written with curly brackets.
print(myset)
#Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
#Set Items
#Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
#Unordered
#Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
#Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

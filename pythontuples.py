#python tuples
# Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data.
# Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses ().
# Tuples can contain any type of data, including other tuples.
# Tuples are often used to return multiple values from a function.

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(mytuple)

#Create a Tuple:
# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)

Eldohub_courses = ("Networking and Cyber Security", "Full Stack Web", "Data Science", "Digital Literacy", "Graphic Design")
print(Eldohub_courses)


#Tuple with mixed data types

mixed_tuples = ("Apple", 1, "Banana", True, "House")
print(mixed_tuples)

#Nested tuples
nested_tuples = (("Apple", "Orange"), (1,2,4,5,6,7))
print(nested_tuples)

#single element tuple
single_element_tuple = (5,)

# # Variables are containers for storing data values.
# # In Python, variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
# # Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
# # Variables can be assigned values using the assignment operator (=).
# # The variable name can be any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores, but it cannot start with a number.
# # Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that "myVar" and "myvar" are considered different variables.
# # Python Variables
x = 5
y = "Hello World"
print(x)
print(y)  # integer
# Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful to make the code more readable.
# It is a good practice to use lowercase letters for variable names and separate words with underscores (e.g., my_variable).

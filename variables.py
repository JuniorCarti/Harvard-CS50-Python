#variables  
# # Variables are containers for storing data values.
# # In Python, variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
# # Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
# # Variables can be assigned values using the assignment operator (=).
# # The variable name can be any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores, but it cannot start with a number.
# # Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that "myVar" and "myvar" are considered different variables.
# # Python Variables
x = 5
y = "Hello World"
print(x)
print(y)  # integer
# Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful to make the code more readable.
# It is a good practice to use lowercase letters for variable names and separate words with underscores (e.g., my_variable).
x = 4
x = "John"
print(x)


# # However, it is also common to use camelCase (e.g., myVariable) in some coding styles.
# # Python is case-sensitive, so "myVar" and "myvar" are different variables.
# # Python allows you to assign multiple variables at once, like this:
# # x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
# # This assigns 1 to x, 2 to y, and 3 to z.
print(x, y, z)
# # You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
# # x = y = z = 0
x = y = z = 0
# # This assigns 0 to x, y, and z.
print(x, y, z)
